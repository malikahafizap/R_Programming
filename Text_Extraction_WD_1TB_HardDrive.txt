  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  Do not buy this. Got it yesterday, plugged it in my laptop. Looked okay, drivers were installed so started taking backup of my old photos and videos. Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

  Bought the first one in Mid may ,it did not had the plastic cover on the drive and it crashed on the very first day.Put a request for replacement ,received it and some how managed to copy 500GB,all the while it intermittently kept throwing \"fatal device hardware error\" and kept freezing.The writing speed dropped to kbps and meanwhile the return period had expired.Now all the data  is lost and the drive is not accessible and the capacity shows 0.00 GB.I wish I had read the 1* reviews before ordering the replacement.Feeling cheated and not at all expected from WD.

  Packaging and everything is excellent. I was excited to use this drive but when I plugged in and stared transferring data. Approx 6-8 GB data I had transferred. After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable. All this incident happened within 10-15 min of data transfer.Really disappointed.

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  Had to return the product because disk was making sound but replacement had the same issue so had to return. Its a manufacturing defect which the company needs to address not the fault of the seller.

  All the previous WD 4 TB hard disks purchased have been durable. this specific model is smaller and more portable. Used this disk to backup a good collection of around 400 gb. post unmounting the device & connecting to another system, the data copy speed deteriorated to less than 1mb/s. I disconnected the usb and make a third attempt - this time the data is not accessible and got message that hard disk needs to be formatted.Nirther the data could be accesssed - even the harddisk cannot be formatted and gives message \"window was unable to complete the format\" . Seeing this unreliability from WD hard disk for the first time

  Tested data transfer. Complete files disappear or incomplete transfer. Laptop switched off on its own several times meaning disk drawing too much power from usb port. Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon. This is my second order from same reseller. Reviews also give bad remarks.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8). No os extrañe por tanto comprobar que vuestro PC informe que el disco tiene una capacidad de 4,54 TB en vez de los 5 TB anunciados. Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  The device works perfectly and can be used on xbox, ps4 pc and Mac however you will not get the full 4tb when I plugged mine in it said that I had 3.6tb available, tried formatting it and still the same, that's 400gb that I can't use on the device I understand that some is needed to be used by the system to make it run etc but not nearly half a terabyte

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.  Have a happy day.

  The physical drive itself is a small, sleek design. Looks like a thicker 2.5in HDD. Theres no visible screws or anything. Everything is quite hidden and minimalist. The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  Do not buy this. Got it yesterday, plugged it in my laptop. Looked okay, drivers were installed so started taking backup of my old photos and videos. Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

  Bought the first one in Mid may ,it did not had the plastic cover on the drive and it crashed on the very first day.Put a request for replacement ,received it and some how managed to copy 500GB,all the while it intermittently kept throwing \"fatal device hardware error\" and kept freezing.The writing speed dropped to kbps and meanwhile the return period had expired.Now all the data  is lost and the drive is not accessible and the capacity shows 0.00 GB.I wish I had read the 1* reviews before ordering the replacement.Feeling cheated and not at all expected from WD.

  Packaging and everything is excellent. I was excited to use this drive but when I plugged in and stared transferring data. Approx 6-8 GB data I had transferred. After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable. All this incident happened within 10-15 min of data transfer.Really disappointed.

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  All the previous WD 4 TB hard disks purchased have been durable. this specific model is smaller and more portable. Used this disk to backup a good collection of around 400 gb. post unmounting the device & connecting to another system, the data copy speed deteriorated to less than 1mb/s. I disconnected the usb and make a third attempt - this time the data is not accessible and got message that hard disk needs to be formatted.Nirther the data could be accesssed - even the harddisk cannot be formatted and gives message \"window was unable to complete the format\" .

  Tested data transfer. Complete files disappear or incomplete transfer. Laptop switched off on its own several times meaning disk drawing too much power from usb port. Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8). No os extrañe por tanto comprobar que vuestro PC informe que el disco tiene una capacidad de 4,54 TB en vez de los 5 TB anunciados. Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  The device works perfectly and can be used on xbox, ps4 pc and Mac however you will not get the full 4tb when I plugged mine in it said that I had 3.6tb available, tried formatting it and still the same, that's 400gb that I can't use on the device I understand that some is needed to be used by the system to make it run etc but not nearly half a terabyte

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.  Have a happy day.

Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  The device works perfectly and can be used on xbox, ps4 pc and Mac however you will not get the full 4tb when I plugged mine in it said that I had 3.6tb available, tried formatting it and still the same, that's 400gb that I can't use on the device I understand that some is needed to be used by the system to make it run etc but not nearly half a terabyte

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.

  The physical drive itself is a small, sleek design. Looks like a thicker 2.5in HDD. Theres no visible screws or anything. Everything is quite hidden and minimalist. The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  Do not buy this. Got it yesterday, plugged it in my laptop. Looked okay, drivers were installed so started taking backup of my old photos and videos. Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

  Bought the first one in Mid may ,it did not had the plastic cover on the drive and it crashed on the very first day.Put a request for replacement ,received it and some how managed to copy 500GB,all the while it intermittently kept throwing \"fatal device hardware error\" and kept freezing.The writing speed dropped to kbps and meanwhile the return period had expired.Now all the data  is lost and the drive is not accessible and the capacity shows 0.00 GB.I wish I had read the 1* reviews before ordering the replacement.Feeling cheated and not at all expected from WD.

  Packaging and everything is excellent. I was excited to use this drive but when I plugged in and stared transferring data. Approx 6-8 GB data I had transferred. After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable. All this incident happened within 10-15 min of data transfer.Really disappointed.

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  All the previous WD 4 TB hard disks purchased have been durable. this specific model is smaller and more portable. Used this disk to backup a good collection of around 400 gb. post unmounting the device & connecting to another system, the data copy speed deteriorated to less than 1mb/s. I disconnected the usb and make a third attempt - this time the data is not accessible and got message that hard disk needs to be formatted.Nirther the data could be accesssed - even the harddisk cannot be formatted and gives message \"window was unable to complete the format\" .

  Tested data transfer. Complete files disappear or incomplete transfer. Laptop switched off on its own several times meaning disk drawing too much power from usb port. Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon. This is my second order from same reseller. Reviews also give bad remarks.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8).

  Tested data transfer. Complete files disappear or incomplete transfer. Laptop switched off on its own several times meaning disk drawing too much power from usb port. Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon. This is my second order from same reseller. Reviews also give bad remarks.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8). No os extrañe por tanto comprobar que vuestro PC informe que el disco tiene una capacidad de 4,54 TB en vez de los 5 TB anunciados. Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.

  The physical drive itself is a small, sleek design. Looks like a thicker 2.5in HDD. Theres no visible screws or anything. Everything is quite hidden and minimalist. The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  Do not buy this. Got it yesterday, plugged it in my laptop. Looked okay, drivers were installed so started taking backup of my old photos and videos. Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

  Packaging and everything is excellent. I was excited to use this drive but when I plugged in and stared transferring data. Approx 6-8 GB data I had transferred. After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable. All this incident happened within 10-15 min of data transfer.Really disappointed.

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  All the previous WD 4 TB hard disks purchased have been durable. this specific model is smaller and more portable. Used this disk to backup a good collection of around 400 gb. post unmounting the device & connecting to another system, the data copy speed deteriorated to less than 1mb/s. I disconnected the usb and make a third attempt - this time the data is not accessible and got message that hard disk needs to be formatted.Nirther the data could be accesssed - even the harddisk cannot be formatted and gives message \"window was unable to complete the format\" .

Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon. This is my second order from same reseller. Reviews also give bad remarks.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8). No os extrañe por tanto comprobar que vuestro PC informe que el disco tiene una capacidad de 4,54 TB en vez de los 5 TB anunciados. Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.

  The physical drive itself is a small, sleek design. Looks like a thicker 2.5in HDD. Theres no visible screws or anything. Everything is quite hidden and minimalist. The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  Do not buy this. Got it yesterday, plugged it in my laptop. Looked okay, drivers were installed so started taking backup of my old photos and videos. Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable.

Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

  Bought the first one in Mid may ,it did not had the plastic cover on the drive and it crashed on the very first day.Put a request for replacement ,received it and some how managed to copy 500GB,all the while it intermittently kept throwing \"fatal device hardware error\" and kept freezing.The writing speed dropped to kbps and meanwhile the return period had expired.Now all the data  is lost and the drive is not accessible and the capacity shows 0.00 GB.I wish I had read the 1* reviews before ordering the replacement.Feeling cheated and not at all expected from WD.

  Packaging and everything is excellent. I was excited to use this drive but when I plugged in and stared transferring data. Approx 6-8 GB data I had transferred. After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable. All this incident happened within 10-15 min of data transfer.Really disappointed.

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  All the previous WD 4 TB hard disks purchased have been durable. this specific model is smaller and more portable. Used this disk to backup a good collection of around 400 gb. post unmounting the device & connecting to another system, the data copy speed deteriorated to less than 1mb/s. I disconnected the usb and make a third attempt - this time the data is not accessible and got message that hard disk needs to be formatted.Nirther the data could be accesssed - even the harddisk cannot be formatted and gives message \"window was unable to complete the format\" .

  Tested data transfer. Complete files disappear or incomplete transfer. Laptop switched off on its own several times meaning disk drawing too much power from usb port. Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon. This is my second order from same reseller. Reviews also give bad remarks.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8). No os extrañe por tanto comprobar que vuestro PC informe que el disco tiene una capacidad de 4,54 TB en vez de los 5 TB anunciados. Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  The device works perfectly and can be used on xbox, ps4 pc and Mac however you will not get the full 4tb when I plugged mine in it said that I had 3.6tb available, tried formatting it and still the same, that's 400gb that I can't use on the device I understand that some is needed to be used by the system to make it run etc but not nearly half a terabyte

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.

  The physical drive itself is a small, sleek design. Looks like a thicker 2.5in HDD. Theres no visible screws or anything. Everything is quite hidden and minimalist. The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  Do not buy this. Got it yesterday, plugged it in my laptop. Looked okay, drivers were installed so started taking backup of my old photos and videos. Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

  Bought the first one in Mid may ,it did not had the plastic cover on the drive and it crashed on the very first day.Put a request for replacement ,received it and some how managed to copy 500GB,all the while it intermittently kept throwing \"fatal device hardware error\" and kept freezing.The writing speed dropped to kbps and meanwhile the return period had expired.Now all the data  is lost and the drive is not accessible and the capacity shows 0.00 GB.I wish I had read the 1* reviews before ordering the replacement.Feeling cheated and not at all expected from WD.

  Packaging and everything is excellent. I was excited to use this drive but when I plugged in and stared transferring data. Approx 6-8 GB data I had transferred. After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable. All this incident happened within 10-15 min of data transfer.Really disappointed.

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  All the previous WD 4 TB hard disks purchased have been durable. this specific model is smaller and more portable. Used this disk to backup a good collection of around 400 gb. post unmounting the device & connecting to another system, the data copy speed deteriorated to less than 1mb/s. I disconnected the usb and make a third attempt - this time the data is not accessible and got message that hard disk needs to be formatted.Nirther the data could be accesssed - even the harddisk cannot be formatted and gives message \"window was unable to complete the format\" . Seeing this unreliability from WD hard disk for the first time

  Tested data transfer. Complete files disappear or incomplete transfer. Laptop switched off on its own several times meaning disk drawing too much power from usb port. Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon. This is my second order from same reseller. Reviews also give bad remarks.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8). No os extrañe por tanto comprobar que vuestro PC informe que el disco tiene una capacidad de 4,54 TB en vez de los 5 TB anunciados. Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  The device works perfectly and can be used on xbox, ps4 pc and Mac however you will not get the full 4tb when I plugged mine in it said that I had 3.6tb available, tried formatting it and still the same, that's 400gb that I can't use on the device I understand that some is needed to be used by the system to make it run etc but not nearly half a terabyte

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.

  The physical drive itself is a small, sleek design. Looks like a thicker 2.5in HDD. Theres no visible screws or anything. Everything is quite hidden and minimalist. The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  Do not buy this. Got it yesterday, plugged it in my laptop. Looked okay, drivers were installed so started taking backup of my old photos and videos. Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

  Bought the first one in Mid may ,it did not had the plastic cover on the drive and it crashed on the very first day.Put a request for replacement ,received it and some how managed to copy 500GB,all the while it intermittently kept throwing \"fatal device hardware error\" and kept freezing.The writing speed dropped to kbps and meanwhile the return period had expired.Now all the data  is lost and the drive is not accessible and the capacity shows 0.00 GB.I wish I had read the 1* reviews before ordering the replacement.Feeling cheated and not at all expected from WD.

  Packaging and everything is excellent. I was excited to use this drive but when I plugged in and stared transferring data. Approx 6-8 GB data I had transferred. After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable. All this incident happened within 10-15 min of data transfer.Really disappointed.

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  All the previous WD 4 TB hard disks purchased have been durable. this specific model is smaller and more portable. Used this disk to backup a good collection of around 400 gb. post unmounting the device & connecting to another system, the data copy speed deteriorated to less than 1mb/s. I disconnected the usb and make a third attempt - this time the data is not accessible and got message that hard disk needs to be formatted.Nirther the data could be accesssed - even the harddisk cannot be formatted and gives message \"window was unable to complete the format\" .

  Tested data transfer. Complete files disappear or incomplete transfer. Laptop switched off on its own several times meaning disk drawing too much power from usb port. Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8). No os extrañe por tanto comprobar que vuestro PC informe que el disco tiene una capacidad de 4,54 TB en vez de los 5 TB anunciados. Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  The device works perfectly and can be used on xbox, ps4 pc and Mac however you will not get the full 4tb when I plugged mine in it said that I had 3.6tb available, tried formatting it and still the same, that's 400gb that I can't use on the device I understand that some is needed to be used by the system to make it run etc but not nearly half a terabyte

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.  Have a happy day.

Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  The device works perfectly and can be used on xbox, ps4 pc and Mac however you will not get the full 4tb when I plugged mine in it said that I had 3.6tb available, tried formatting it and still the same, that's 400gb that I can't use on the device I understand that some is needed to be used by the system to make it run etc but not nearly half a terabyte

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.

  The physical drive itself is a small, sleek design. Looks like a thicker 2.5in HDD. Theres no visible screws or anything. Everything is quite hidden and minimalist. The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  Do not buy this. Got it yesterday, plugged it in my laptop. Looked okay, drivers were installed so started taking backup of my old photos and videos. Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

  Bought the first one in Mid may ,it did not had the plastic cover on the drive and it crashed on the very first day.Put a request for replacement ,received it and some how managed to copy 500GB,all the while it intermittently kept throwing \"fatal device hardware error\" and kept freezing.The writing speed dropped to kbps and meanwhile the return period had expired.Now all the data  is lost and the drive is not accessible and the capacity shows 0.00 GB.I wish I had read the 1* reviews before ordering the replacement.Feeling cheated and not at all expected from WD.

  Packaging and everything is excellent. I was excited to use this drive but when I plugged in and stared transferring data. Approx 6-8 GB data I had transferred. After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable. All this incident happened within 10-15 min of data transfer.Really disappointed.

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  All the previous WD 4 TB hard disks purchased have been durable. this specific model is smaller and more portable. Used this disk to backup a good collection of around 400 gb. post unmounting the device & connecting to another system, the data copy speed deteriorated to less than 1mb/s. I disconnected the usb and make a third attempt - this time the data is not accessible and got message that hard disk needs to be formatted.Nirther the data could be accesssed - even the harddisk cannot be formatted and gives message \"window was unable to complete the format\" .

  Tested data transfer. Complete files disappear or incomplete transfer. Laptop switched off on its own several times meaning disk drawing too much power from usb port. Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon. This is my second order from same reseller. Reviews also give bad remarks.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8).

  Tested data transfer. Complete files disappear or incomplete transfer. Laptop switched off on its own several times meaning disk drawing too much power from usb port. Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon. This is my second order from same reseller. Reviews also give bad remarks.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8). No os extrañe por tanto comprobar que vuestro PC informe que el disco tiene una capacidad de 4,54 TB en vez de los 5 TB anunciados. Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.

  The physical drive itself is a small, sleek design. Looks like a thicker 2.5in HDD. Theres no visible screws or anything. Everything is quite hidden and minimalist. The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  Do not buy this. Got it yesterday, plugged it in my laptop. Looked okay, drivers were installed so started taking backup of my old photos and videos. Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

  Packaging and everything is excellent. I was excited to use this drive but when I plugged in and stared transferring data. Approx 6-8 GB data I had transferred. After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable. All this incident happened within 10-15 min of data transfer.Really disappointed.

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  I purchased WD My Passport 2TB External Hard drive 4 months ago apprx INR 5500 , now it has stopped working completely. Initially it was working smoothly and superb . Now it is giving fatal hardware error . They  sent me a defective product , i never expected this from WD. When i asked to their customer support for the backup of my data , initially they said me to backup my 1.3TB data on dropbox which makes no sense and completely illogical, now they are saying me to visit any third party for backup my 1.3 TB data for which i will get charged there.Good thing is that they will replace the hard drive but for that i have to reach their service center which is around 220km away from my home.Worst service from WD .

  Had to return the product because disk was making sound but replacement had the same issue so had to return. Its a manufacturing defect which the company needs to address not the fault of the seller.

  All the previous WD 4 TB hard disks purchased have been durable. this specific model is smaller and more portable. Used this disk to backup a good collection of around 400 gb. post unmounting the device & connecting to another system, the data copy speed deteriorated to less than 1mb/s. I disconnected the usb and make a third attempt - this time the data is not accessible and got message that hard disk needs to be formatted.Nirther the data could be accesssed - even the harddisk cannot be formatted and gives message \"window was unable to complete the format\" . Seeing this unreliability from WD hard disk for the first time

  Tested data transfer. Complete files disappear or incomplete transfer. Laptop switched off on its own several times meaning disk drawing too much power from usb port. Very low data transfer rate meaning disk not functioning at proper speed. See photographs and video. Disc writing defective. I want refund. This reseller should be banned from Amazon. This is my second order from same reseller. Reviews also give bad remarks.

  Empieza a ser habitual que los fabricantes de tecnología saquen al mercado nuevas versiones de productos bajando su calidad y prestaciones. Incluso se han eliminado las patas de goma que siempre han llevado los modelos superiores de este fabricante, lo que conlleva que transmita más facilmente las vibraciones al girar y que se deslice con demasiada facilidad.Este es el caso de este nuevo disco de Western Digital, que ha bajado en tamaño físico,-lo que está muy bien-, aumentado en capacidad,-que también esta bien-, pero bajando las prestaciones, lo que ya no está tan bien; nada bien, en realidad.Respecto de la serie anterior, el rendimiento es entre un 25% y un 35% inferior. Esto se traduce en que, al copiar contenido, donde la versión anterior mantenía unos dignos 80-90 MB/s ahora se obtienen 50-60MB/s. En mi opinión, esto es inaceptable. Por poner un ejemplo, para copiar 4 TB necesitarás más de 36 horas, 12 horas más que con la serie anterior. Y hablando de Teras, ya sabréis que la industria juega a manipular los datos sobre capacidades hablando de teras no informaticos (base 10) en vez de los que cualquier usuario espera (base 8). No os extrañe por tanto comprobar que vuestro PC informe que el disco tiene una capacidad de 4,54 TB en vez de los 5 TB anunciados. Me parece poco ético que utilicen una medición fuera del ámbito PC y más propios de la industria de las telecomunicaciones.Por todo ello, y en mi opinión, no es un producto recomendable.Añado que es mucho más ruidoso que la serie anterior. Yo creo que es debido al fino plástico de la carcasa que hace de caja de resonancia cuando gira.

  The device works perfectly and can be used on xbox, ps4 pc and Mac however you will not get the full 4tb when I plugged mine in it said that I had 3.6tb available, tried formatting it and still the same, that's 400gb that I can't use on the device I understand that some is needed to be used by the system to make it run etc but not nearly half a terabyte

  They have a file on the drive called \"Install Discovery for Windows\".  It is an executable file and if you do not know why it is there (like me) then you should note that it actually turns on a whole lot of sharing.  I didn't realize that and pressed 'Yes' when I shouldn't have.  If you like sharing everything then go ahead.  if not then press 'No' and proceed.  The drive works flawlessly.PS Amazon - If you don't like this review then delete it and do not ask me for a better one.  I'll just ignore it.  You did that once and that was enough.  Have a happy day.

  The physical drive itself is a small, sleek design. Looks like a thicker 2.5in HDD. Theres no visible screws or anything. Everything is quite hidden and minimalist. The only visible features are a USB port and a LED light.WD claims this product to be \"plug and play\", ready straight out of the box. Mine disagrees and requires me to format the drive before I can use, potentially losing any pdfs or readmes if there were any inside the drive.SMART tests results returned OK.(refer to image)Overall a decent drive with decent space at an affordable price BUT the read/write speeds are painfully low, especially with smaller files and folders; which to be honest, is expected of a drive which doesnt require an external power supply. Compared to the WD Elements Ext HDD, I could easily achieve speeds of up to 3-10mb/s. With This HDD, speeds may start off at 50mb/s but slowly decrease until its around 1,50mb/s for large files and about 50kb/s for smaller files. Moving 40gb could take up to \"18 hours\". Again, refer to images for example.If you plan on purchasing this drive, I suggest you only use it for backup purposes. Viewing videos on the drive can also be a headache.1 star for WD, and an overall reliable and robust HDD,1 star for the cost since its quite affordable for a 5tb HDD.

  WD is the first option comes in mind while looking for a storage device because of their quality and price to performance ratio with good aesthetics. Here is my extensive opinion about WD My Passport New Edition :FOR :1. Excellent performance2. Complete software package3. Class leading pricing4. Elegant design with variety of colours5. Software + 256 bit hardware encryption6. 3 years of warrantyAGAINST :1. No USB C port2. No hard case or travel bag includedDESIGN :My Passport drive has a nicely angled two-tone black & grey color scheme with one half of the lower scalloped for grip. Matte finish throughout the body helps in better grip. It's available in multiple cool colours so pick one according to your personality.PERFORMANCE :My Passport HDD has excellent price to performance ratio. It's delivering stable performance with read & write speed upto 126 MB/s in actual usage.CrystalDiskMark Read Speed : 132 MB/sCrystalDiskMark Write Speed : 126 MB/sActual Read Speed : 124 MB/sActual Write Speed : 118 MB/sBUILD QUALITY :My Passport is completely made out of plastic. I think it can easily survive casual drops but Iwould highly recommend to use a hard case to protect your HDD and most importantly data.Cable quality is pretty excellent.SOFTWARE :HDD comes with a pre loaded WD Discovery software. Storage management, securityencryption and cloud backup settings can be accessed using this software. It supports most of cloud platforms Security encryption is really helpful in keeping confidential data safe.FINAL THOUGHTS :Considering beautiful compact design, performance, stability and 3 years of warranty for peace of mind, WD My Passport New Edition is a perfect storage device for most of the average consumers. Just go for it.I hope this helped you. <U+0001F642>

  Do not buy this. Got it yesterday, plugged it in my laptop. Looked okay, drivers were installed so started taking backup of my old photos and videos. Midway through this, it started throwing \"Fatal hardware error\". Didn't know what to do. Tried it on another port but it just makes a clicking sound and windows no longer lists this drive. Recovery software requires you to initialize the drive (mbr/gbt) but trying to do that throws the same error. Tried again on an ubuntu laptop, same issue. I can't return this product because half of my videos and photos are copied onto it. In short, I wasted almost 4k on this useless disk.

  Bought the first one in Mid may ,it did not had the plastic cover on the drive and it crashed on the very first day.Put a request for replacement ,received it and some how managed to copy 500GB,all the while it intermittently kept throwing \"fatal device hardware error\" and kept freezing.The writing speed dropped to kbps and meanwhile the return period had expired.Now all the data  is lost and the drive is not accessible and the capacity shows 0.00 GB.I wish I had read the 1* reviews before ordering the replacement.Feeling cheated and not at all expected from WD.

  Packaging and everything is excellent. I was excited to use this drive but when I plugged in and stared transferring data. Approx 6-8 GB data I had transferred. After sometime I got error for transfer. I have removed the USB and plugged in again but drive is not showing in \"My Computer\" then I have checked and I found that drive having technical issue i.e. \"THE REQUEST FAILED DUE TO A FATAL DEVICE HARDWARE ERROR.\" Which means hard drive not useable. All this incident happened within 10-15 min of data transfer.Really disappointed.
